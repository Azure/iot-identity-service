# `az resource list` has `--tag` to filter, but it cannot be combined with `--resource-group`,
# so we need to query with `--resource-group` and then filter using tags ourselves.
#
# Also, sometimes deleting resources fails because `az resource delete` doesn't respect inter-resource dependencies.
# So keep trying it in a loop as long as there are still resources that match.
