# Running the services locally

1. Follow the steps in [Building the services](../building.md) to build the services.

1. (Optional) If you want to test the `aziot-keyd` with PKCS#11, see [Setting up your PKCS#11 library](pkcs11/_index.md)

1. Create an Azure IoT Hub and an Azure IoT Device identity in that IoT Hub. Depending on the auth method you choose for the device identity, the services will be configured accordingly later.

    - If the device identity is set to use the `shared_private_key` auth method, retain one of the SAS keys generated by IoT Hub.

    - If the device identity is set to use the `x509_thumbprint` auth method, create a device ID cert and retain its private key and public X.509 PEM.

    - If the device identity is set to use the `x509_ca` auth method, create a device ID CA cert and retain its private key and public X.509 PEM.

    For `x509_thumbprint` and `x509_ca`, you can use hardware-backed private keys for the certs if you're using PKCS#11.

1. Start `aziot-keyd` in one shell.

    ```sh
    # The directory where key files will be stored. The service will read this env var.
    export HOMEDIR_PATH=~/iotedge/hsm/keys
    mkdir -p "$HOMEDIR_PATH"
    ```

    If you want to use PKCS#11:

    ```sh
    # Ensure the PKCS11_LIB_PATH env var is set. You should've set it as part of step 2.
    echo "$PKCS11_LIB_PATH"

    # PKCS11_BASE_SLOT is the PKCS#11 URI of a slot that will be used to store new keys.
    #
    # TOKEN_PARAM and PIN_SUFFIX were set as part of step 2.
    export PKCS11_BASE_SLOT="pkcs11:$TOKEN_PARAM$PIN_SUFFIX"

    # The service will read these two env vars.
    ```

    Finally, run the service with parameters corresponding to the auth method of the device identity.

    - If the device identity is set to use the `shared_private_key` auth method, run the service without any parameters:

        ```sh
        "$PWD/target/debug/aziot-keyd"
        ```

    - If the device identity is set to use the `x509_thumbprint` auth method, preload the private key of the device ID cert into `aziot-keyd`:

        ```sh
        env 'PRELOADED_KEY:device-id=file:///path/to/key.pem' "$PWD/target/debug/aziot-keyd"
        ```

    - If the device identity is set to use the `x509_ca` auth method, preload the private key of the device ID CA cert into `aziot-keyd`:

        ```sh
        env 'PRELOADED_KEY:device-id-ca=file:///path/to/key.pem' "$PWD/target/debug/aziot-keyd"
        ```

    For `x509_thumbprint` and `x509_ca`, if the keys are backed by hardware, use a `pkcs11:` URI instead of a `file://` URI.

    The server will remain running.

1. Start `aziot-certd` in another shell. See [Configuring and running `aziot-certd`](aziot-certd.md)

1. Start `aziot-identityd` in another shell. See [Configuring and running `aziot-identityd`](aziot-identityd.md)

1. Run `iotedged` in a third shell

    - If the device identity is set to use the `shared_private_key` auth method, run the program with the SAS key:

        ```sh
        "$PWD/target/debug/iotedged" -- --hub-id 'example.azure-devices.net' --device-id 'example-1' --sas-key 'QXp1cmUgSW9UIEVkZ2U='
        ```

    - If the device identity is set to use the `x509_thumbprint` auth method, run the program with the identifier of the device ID cert and private key:

        ```sh
        # The value of `--preloaded-device-id-cert` matches the name of the `PRELOADED_KEY:` and `PRELOADED_CERT:` env vars set above.
        "$PWD/target/debug/iotedged" -- --hub-id 'example.azure-devices.net' --device-id 'example-1' --preloaded-device-id-cert 'device-id'
        ```

    - If the device identity is set to use the `x509_ca` auth method, run the program with the identifier of the device ID CA cert and private key:

        ```sh
        # The value of `--preloaded-device-id-ca-cert` matches the name of the `PRELOADED_KEY:` and `PRELOADED_CERT:` env vars set above.
        "$PWD/target/debug/iotedged" -- --hub-id 'example.azure-devices.net' --device-id 'example-1' --preloaded-device-id-ca-cert 'device-id-ca'
        ```

`iotedged` is a prototype that performs some operations that would be done by the Identity Service or Edge Module Runtime. Specifically, it connects to `aziot-keyd` and `aziot-certd` and does the following:

1. Create a self-signed device CA cert.

1. Create a workload CA cert signed by the device CA cert.

1. Connect to IoT Hub using the device identity, using an auth method based on the parameters given to it:

    - When `--sas-key` is provided:
        1. Import the IoT Hub SAS key into `aziot-keyd`
        1. Connect to the IoT Hub and perform a list modules HTTP request. The SAS token for this request is signed using the SAS key imported into `aziot-keyd`.

    - When `--preloaded-device-id-cert` is provided:
        1. Connect to the IoT Hub and perform a list modules HTTP request. The key and cert preloaded into `aziot-keyd` and `aziot-certd` respectively are used for TLS client authentication.

    - When `--preloaded-device-id-ca-cert` is provided:
        1. Obtain the device ID CA cert whose ID is specified by the parameter.
        1. Create a new device ID certificate using `aziot-certd` that is signed by the device ID CA cert.
        1. Connect to the IoT Hub and perform a list modules HTTP request. The device ID cert created in the previous step is used for TLS client authentication.
