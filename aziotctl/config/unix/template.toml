# Cloud Timeout and Retry Behavior
# ==============================================================================
#
# These settings control the timeout and retries for cloud operations, such as
# communication with DPS during provisioning or IoT Hub for module identity creation.
#
# cloud_timeout_sec is the deadline (in seconds) for a network request (such as
# an HTTP request) to the aforementioned cloud services. A response from the cloud
# must be received before this deadline, or the request will fail as timed out.
#
# cloud_retries controls how many times a request may be retried should it fail.
# The client will always send at least one attempt, so its value will be the number
# of retries after the first attempt should that fail (i.e. cloud_retries = 2
# means that the client will make a total of 3 attempts). 
#
# cloud_timeout_sec has a minimum of 70s to allow hub to throttle requests. 
# If a request is throttled, it will enter an exponential backoff with 4 retries instead
# of using the configured value. The configured value is used for all other errors.
#
# cloud_timeout_sec = 70
# cloud_retries = 1
