# IoT Identity Services for Edge Devices

This repository contains the code for a set of loosely coupled device services that together enable a basic "runtime" for edge devices connecting to Azure. These services provide identity provisioning, certificate, and key management.

# Architecture

See [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) for an overview of these services and their relation to [`Azure IoT Edge`](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge).
