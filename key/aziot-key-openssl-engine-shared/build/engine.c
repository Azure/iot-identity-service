/**
 * The openssl engine API uses two macros - IMPLEMENT_DYNAMIC_BIND_FN and IMPLEMENT_DYNAMIC_CHECK_FN - to register the engine's entrypoint.
 *
 * The underlying bind function that the macros expand to are not stable across openssl versions, so it's not easy to invoke them directly from Rust.
 * Therefore we use the macros in this C file.
 *
 * There is one more problem however. When compiling the cdylib, rustc uses a version script that only lists globals that rustc knows about.
 * So the bind_engine and v_check functions generated by these two macros will not actually be exported by the final cdylib. It's not possible
 * to provide a custom version script via `cargo:rustc-cdylib-link-arg` because it conflicts with the one generated by rustc.
 *
 * So we have to use the other way mentioned by `ld`'s docs, `__asm__(".symver")`
 *
 * Unfortunately this trick means this crate cannot be compiled for tests since the linker will see duplicate symbols, so every invocation of
 * `cargo test --all` or `cargo clippy --tests --all` has to also exclude this crate with `--exclude`.
