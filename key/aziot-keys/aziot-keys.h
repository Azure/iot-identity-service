 * All functions return an `unsigned int` to indicate success or failure. See the [`AZIOT_KEYS_RC`] type's docs for details about these constants.
 *
 * The only function exported by this library is [`aziot_keys_get_function_list`]. Call this function to get the version of the API

 *
 * All calls to [`aziot_keys_get_function_list`] or any function in [`AZIOT_KEYS_FUNCTION_LIST`] are serialized, ie a function will not be called
 * while another function is running. However, it is not guaranteed that all function calls will be made from the same operating system thread.
 * Thus, implementations do not need to worry about locking to prevent concurrent access, but should also not store data in thread-local storage.
